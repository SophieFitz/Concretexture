This mod provides new texture options to replace the original uneven textures for concrete and refined concrete.

The following options are available for both concrete and refined concrete:

**Original concrete** - the unmodified Factorio concrete texture </br>
**Original refined concrete** - the unmodified Factorio refined concrete texture </br>
**Smooth concrete** - looks like the original, but repaired and smoothed </br>
**Smooth refined concrete** - the original refined concrete, but with the gaps lightly filled in and smoothed down to look less uneven </br>
**Grid Concrete** - a grid style similar to Factorio 0.15 and earlier, based on textures by [Kamsta99](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Kamsta99)

If you really want to you can indeed make concrete look like refined concrete (and vice versa).

There is an additional option called Concrete Path that allows you to replace the default stone path texture with the original concrete texture.

All changes are purely cosmetic and have no effect on recipes, technologies, pollution or run speed.
The texture used for refined concrete will also be applied to the tinted concrete tiles found in the scenario editor.
